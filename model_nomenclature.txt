Please be aware that the models differ between the FPHA & NTU120 Dataset, as our method is only applied to hand joints.
While all joints from the FPHA dataset are used, a subset of NTU120 joints is used.

All model names are given as follows:
action recognition model _ method _ l _ attribute _ further information (i/a)

The options for each component are detailed below:
action recognition model: gcnbl, ctrgcn
method: LSHR (angular embeddings), LSHT (Spherical Transform)
l: l parameter of Spherical Harmonics
attribute: magnitude (mag), phase (phase), magphase (magnitude & phase), real (real), imaginary (imag), ri (real & imaginary)
further information: BL (model with the same dimensions as name implies. Random numbers concatenated), excl (no Cartesian coordinates used), spherical coord (spherical coordinates used instead of LSHT/LSHR)
